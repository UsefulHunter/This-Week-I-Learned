# This-Week-I-Learned
I think that this will be the core code of my blog, that I will try to show to the world(or ZA WARUDO, if you prefer), what i'm learning in terms of code.


# The Steps that I'll be taking, to make this work, are:

1. Make this run locally. All the starting functionalities, the core base. This will be completely baby-step moved

2. Learn how to deploy this. After all, i need to show this to the world.

3. Keep improving it.
